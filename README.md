## Design

### Colour Scheme

The palette of colours were chosen after doing a little research to find out which colours were specific to a trustworthy and friendly brand.
The variations of easy and light blue reflect the calmness and welcoming tone of the business and what they stand for. The pallete was discovered using 
Color Hunt. [Here is the exact link](https://colorhunt.co/palette/f5efffe5d9f2cdc1ffa294f9) to the palette.

The colours mainly used were:

### Typography 

- Header Font: The font used for all headers was 'Cabin Sketch', imported from Google fonts.
  This font was consistent with the brand tone (friendly, calm, playful).

- Paragraph Font: The font for regular text is 'Outfit', which is also calm but contrasting to the header font.

### Imagery 

- All images were sources from ![Dreamstime](https://www.dreamstime.com/?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=22463944440&gbraid=0AAAAA_ZeP4BR30TPCyxZl7KqV3DrTOPEC&gclid=Cj0KCQjwxJvBBhDuARIsAGUgNfjWCeCw3mx6ZqAVDyNDhsNlTlGrZAGthEoQVywDaRvWlPoYwbvHWUgaAuIaEALw_wcB#res56964943)
- The contact/booking page includes a map implemented from Google that is interactive.

### Wireframes 

Mock-ups of the home page, services and booking page were created using Balsamiq. They were created for mobiles, tablets and desktops. 

- ![Wireframes](https://balsamiq.cloud/sb2mrbr/ppikq61/rA886)

### Features to Implement

In the future, I want to implement Java Script and create more pages for the site. 
The goal is to use it as a template to improve my front-end ability. 

I would like to create an interactive form that modifies and adds new questions in real-time as the user progresses through it by filling in the form.

### Lighthouse

I had done testing with Lighthouse throughout the project to ensure users have the best experience. After the initial tests on all pages, I spoke with tutors and it was clear that
I needed to decrease imager sizes and minimise CSS. 

However, having completed the recommended tasks, the results were still not optimal. I have noted this, and so in the future I will learn how to achieve optimal performance and update this website as I continue my learning.
