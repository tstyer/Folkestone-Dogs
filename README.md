## Introduction

Welcome to the Folkestone Dogs project.

This is a simple, responsive website built using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. It serves as a foundation for the small (fictional) business, local to the Folkestone, Kent area. They specialise in daycare and training services for dogs of all breeds. The structure of the site is clean, minimal and consistent.

## User Experience (UX)

### Project Scope

The goal for the 'Folkestone Dogs' website is to show prospective clients that they are the best option for dog daycare and training in the area. It offers this through easy navigation, understandable text, and an intuitive layout. 

### Demographics

The main users of the site will be couples who have recently adopted or purchased a new dog. They will ideally be located in the Folkestone area, but likely clients will come from the whole of Kent. 
There is no particular age, but the majority will likely be late-20's to mid-40's, men and women. 

### User Requirements/Expectations

1. Immediately what Folkestone Dogs do in the header and subheads of the homepage.
2. Provide service information on the homepage.
3. Address safety concerns by giving social proof and qualifications.
4. An easy to navigate website that is consistent.
5. See clear and understandable information.
6. See contact details throughout.
7. Offer responsiveness for mobile, tablet, desktop and interaction when hovering over links.

### User Stories

#### Target User Goals

The goal for the target user will be to learn who Folkestone Dogs are, what makes them unique, why they should book their initial visit with the company, and then to proceed with a booking. 
They will be searching for a local business that can offer training and/or daycare services 7 days per week, 365 days per year. 
They'll be looking for reliability in the business by different means, and to find their contact information easily. 

#### First-Time Visitors

1. As a first-time visitor, I want to see why I should choose Folkestone dogs over another business.
2. As a first time visitor, I want to read about their services, experience and qualifications on the first page.
3. As a first-time visitor, I want to easily navigate to any contact information or page.
4. As a first-time visitor, I want to see where the business is located.

#### As a Returning Visitor

1. As a returning visitor, I want to easily navigate to their contact/booking page.
2. As a returning visitor, I want to easily find their social media links to see their social proof with current clients.
3. As a returning visitor, I want to see compelling images.
4. As a returning visitor, I'd like to easily access and navigate the site via a mobile or tablet. 

### Site Owner Goals

My goals for Folkestone Dogs are to create an engaging and user-friendly site that appeals to the desires of the target audience. The goal will be to showcase the reliability of the business
through simple and clean descriptions that stand out from their background. 

Other Sit Owner Goals:
- To boost online bookings by inspiring the reader.
- To build trust with potential future clients via social proof, achievements, images and descriptions.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

The palette of colours were chosen after doing a little research to find which would represent a trustworthy and friendly brand.
The variations of light blue reflect the calmness and welcoming tone of the business and what they stand for. The palette was discovered using 
Color Hunt. [Here is the exact link](https://colorhunt.co/palette/f5efffe5d9f2cdc1ffa294f9) to the palette.

The colours mainly used were:

![Picture of the colours used](assets/images/screenshot-of-colours.jpeg)

### Typography 

Text was written in fonts taken from 'Google Fonts':

- Header Font: The font used for all headers was 'Cabin Sketch'.
  This font was consistent with the brand tone (friendly, calm, playful).

- Paragraph Font: The font for regular text is 'Outfit', which is also calm but contrasting to the header font.

### Imagery 

- All images were sources from [Dreamstime](https://www.dreamstime.com/?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=22463944440&gbraid=0AAAAA_ZeP4BR30TPCyxZl7KqV3DrTOPEC&gclid=Cj0KCQjwxJvBBhDuARIsAGUgNfjWCeCw3mx6ZqAVDyNDhsNlTlGrZAGthEoQVywDaRvWlPoYwbvHWUgaAuIaEALw_wcB#res56964943)
- The contact/booking page includes a map, where code was taken from Google and implemented.

### Wire Frames 

Mock-ups of the home page, services and booking page were created using Balsamiq. They were created for mobiles, tablets and desktops. 

All wire frames will be found here:

- [Wireframes](https://balsamiq.cloud/sb2mrbr/ppikq61/rA886)

### Features to Implement

In the future, I want to implement Java Script and create more pages for the site. 
The goal is to use it as a template to improve my front-end ability. 

## Technologies Used

### Development Tools

- HTML5: For the mark-up language. 

- CSS3: for styling

- VS Code: Local IDE to commit and push changes once made. 

- Balsamiq: Used to create blueprints or wire frames.

- Github: To host my code.

- Bootstrap 5.3: For implementing pre-built code that is responsive.

#### index.html 

No errors or warnings to show:

### CSS Validation

No errors or warnings to show:

### Lighthouse

I had done testing with Lighthouse throughout the project to ensure users have the best experience. After the initial tests on all pages, I spoke with tutors and it was clear that
I needed to decrease imager sizes and minimise CSS. 

However, having completed the recommended tasks, the results were still not optimal. I have noted this, and so in the future I will learn how to achieve optimal performance and update this website as I continue my learning.

These user tests confirm the website is fully functional and user-friendly, providing a seamless experience for visitors.

### Responsiveness

The website was tested on Microsoft Edge, Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer across different sizes for responsiveness.

Mobiles: 

- Mobiles: 320px (Max)
- iPhone SE

Tablets:

- iPad Air
- iPad Pro

Desktops:

- Laptop (1024px's +)
- Desktop (1440px's +)

### Browser Compatability

The website was tested on Microsoft Edge, Chrome, Internet Explorer, and Firefox and works as expected. 

## Bugs

### Carousel Not Displaying Text

Issue: When first implementing the carousel, the paragraph text did not show on smaller screens.
Fix: Added a media query that shrinks the font size to smaller.

### Homepage Images Uneaven

Issue: displaying the homepage on tablet sizes created an uneven image display. 
Fix: Changed the display to Flex, added space-between, flex-grow to 1, and flex-direction of column.

### Missing Alt Text

Issue: The images on the homepage had missing alt text.
Fix: Added alt tags and included the text.

### Uneven Footer Elements

Issue: The footer displayed uneven links at the full size and smaller sizes. 
Fix: Ensured the padding-top was at 5px for all top-level links and items were aligned to the centre. 

### Map Display Was Too Small

Issue: The map on the booking page was too narrow. 
Fix: By selecting it in CSS, I set the width to 100%. 

### Navigation Bar Burger 

Issue: Nav. Bar displaying on the wrong side (right) when screen size minimised. 
Fix: This was due to the placement of the anchor tag (Folkestone Dogs). I moved it next to the end of the buttons closing tag.

## Validation Errors

### HTML

#### Sections

The use of sections was flagged when there was no use of headings. Thus, I removed the section to replace it with div's. 

#### Improper Closing tags

Self-closing elements included forward slashed, so I removed them as suggested. 

### CSS

#### ID's

Too many ID's were used, then removed as suggested. 

## Image Testing

After running Lighthouse, the images were clearly marked, and I learned they were far too large. I then downloaded smaller versions.

## Conclusion

This project was a steep learning curve, and I thoroughly enjoyed the process. It also helped me understand my passion for front-end development, and is what I will pursue moving forward. 

I have learned about areas of improvement, and will implement changes to this website as I progress. 

Help from tutors, and my mentor was second-to-none, and this makes me feel confident going into the next projects.
